# InCity - An E-Commerce Website

![alt text](https://github.com/abdeali004/InCity/blob/master/Project_Images/HomePage.png?raw=true)

It is an e-commerce platform that handles data of three different types of users: Wholesalers, retailers, and customers. The overall idea behind the project is to merge all three types of users and interact with them together to fulfill their needs within the city.

Rights:		    Buy		Sell	Create Shop     Login
Customers	    True	False	False           True
Retailers		True	True	True            True
Wholesalers	    False	True	True            True
